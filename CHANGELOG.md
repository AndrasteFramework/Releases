## New in Version 0.3.1
- Fixed loading of plugins
- New [semi-automatic](https://github.com/AndrasteFramework/andraste-distribution-builder) distribution build process, to streamline updates/building
- Shipping both 32bit and 64bit GenericFrameworks and thus relocating the folders in the default bundle.
- UILauncher now supports the new folder structure and thus 32bit and 64bit.
- 
## New in Version 0.3.0 [YANKED]
- Support for declaring explicit dependencies on other mods and builtin features => otherwise loading will be prevented
- This version has been _yanked_ because faulty (incomplete) .config files (Andraste.Payload.Generic.dll.config) prevented the loading of plugins
